# McLennon Ergodox Layout for OS X

This keymapping is designed for use on my Mac OS X while taking advantage of the Ergodox features. Caps lock instead enables a layer which allows use of HJKL as arrow keys and control media. Shift and control have additional mappings on S and D to provide easier access while holding down caps lock.

If you choose to compile this yourself, be sure to compile with `#define PREVENT_STUCK_MODIFIERS` in your config.h. Firmware was built using [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/). To compile yourself, I'd recommend consulting the README from the following commit: [65b0eff](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/65b0eff6d863d458464c35a8571071ad4a519af5/keyboards/ergodox)
